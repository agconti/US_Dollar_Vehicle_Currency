    A decorator to take a function's docstring and perform string

    Usage: construct a docstring.Substitution with a sequence or
    dictionary suitable for performing substitution; then
    decorate a suitable function with the constructed object. e.g.

    sub_author_name = Substitution(author='Jason')

    Make function raise KnownFailureTest exception if given condition is true.

    If the condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically
    make the decision. This is useful for tests that may require costly
    imports, to delay the cost until the test suite is actually executed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fail_condition : bool or callable
        Flag to determine whether to mark the decorated test as a known
        failure (if True) or not (if False).
    msg : str, optional

    Returns
    -------
    decorator : function
        Decorator, which, when applied to a function, causes SkipTest
        to be raised when `skip_condition` is True, and the function
        to be called normally otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    The decorator itself is decorated with the ``nose.tools.make_decorator``
    function in order to transmit function name, and various other metadata.
